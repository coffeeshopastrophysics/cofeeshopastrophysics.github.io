                    <p> In spite of the continuation of COVID-19, we didn't want to completely fall off of the face of the Earth!  We realize many of you may be itching for more astronomy, so we are going to begin a virtual talk series in the mean time.  Our team has been working hard to figure out the logistics of all of this, but we think we can continue to put together talks that you will enjoy, and hopefully by going virtual we can even reach people in a wider community.</p>
                    <p> So please keep an eye out for us on social media and check our schedule for upcoming talks.  These will be posted to our YouTube channel, and while we certainly encourage you to attend the livestreamed event, the videos will continue to remain accessible afterwards for you to watch whenever is convenient!</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p> These are a series of informal public lectures aimed at anyone interested in getting a taste of modern science, all from the comfort of your local coffee shop. Members of the <a href='https://cgca.uwm.edu/'>Leonard E Parker Center for Gravitation, Cosmology and Astrophysics</a> will guide you through the interesting, unusual, and sometimes bizarre concepts that guide the modern understanding of our universe. At the end of each lecture, we hope to have rekindled or ignited a passion for astrophysics!</p>
                    <p> Lectures will begin at <font color='gold'>1 pm on the Saturdays</font> specified in the schedule.</p>
                    <p> Please explore our website to find out more about CoffeeShop Astrophysics. Check our schedule for details about lecture topics, dates, the location of this lecture series, and who we are. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us! Looking forward to meeting and discussing science with you.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p> After nearly 15 years, the Mars rover Opportunity has finally come to its mission's end.  On February 13th, NASA announced that they would no longer continue trying to establish contact with the rover, after a dust storm last summer had caused it to enter a low power state from which it never bounced back.  Its twin rover Spirit ended its mission in 2011, and together the two rovers will continue on in the legacy of the knowledge which they revealed about the Red Planet.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p> Recently, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations along with many astronomers announced the first ever observation of a merger of two neutron stars.  Besides being the first direct observation of a neutron star merger, it was also the first event detected by observing both gravitational waves and light (electromagnetic waves).  The resulting scientific impact of the joint observations is monumental and has lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying physics of these exotic objects and events.  The face of how we do astronomy has been revolutionized!</p>
                    <!--<p> Back in February of 2016 we had the most attended and exciting CoffeeShop Astrophysics talk to date on the discovery of gravitational waves.  We hope again to stir that same kind of excitement this November, not only in this momentous discovery but also with the Nobel Prize (see below), as well as the many other incredible discoveries that LIGO has made in the last year!
                    <p>  So please join us again on <font color='gold'>Saturday, November 11th</font>, bring your friends and family, and get excited to learn more about the amazing things LIGO is revealing about our universe around us.</p>
