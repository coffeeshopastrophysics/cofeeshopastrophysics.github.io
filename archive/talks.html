            <p> At 2.5 million light-years from Earth, the Andromeda galaxy is the most distant object that a human can
                see with the naked eye. While it may seem like just a tiny blob of light against the night sky,
                Andromeda, along with billions of other galaxies in our universe, contain hundreds of billions of stars
                as well as more powerful compact objects lurking deep within their cores. Galaxies come in all shapes
                and sizes and reveal much about the dynamics and structure of our universe. Come to our talk and learn
                all about galaxies, from their humble beginnings to their strange and mysterious ends, and everything in
                between!

            </h5>
            <p>Volcanoes are some of the most spectacular and powerful forces shaping planetary landscapes. They not
                only sculpt the surface but also influence the atmosphere and potential habitability of a world. In our
                own solar system, Jupiter's moon Io stands out as the most volcanically active body. Its surface is a
                constantly changing tapestry, driven by interior tidal stresses that cover its surface in volcanic
                craters. In this talk, we'll embark on a journey from Io's changing landscape to the surfaces of distant
                planets orbiting other stars. We'll explore how the same tidal forces that energize Io might also ignite
                volcanoes on worlds far beyond our solar system. Specifically, we'll delve into the intriguing L 98-59
                system, where Earth-sized planets may be experiencing their own volcanic activity due to similar
                gravitational interactions that occur in the Io-Jupiter system.</p>

            <p>Stars live and die on expansive timescales. They jiggle, they wiggle, they expand, they spin, they orbit,
                and they oscillate on their journey throughout the universe. From scales ranging from the surface of a
                star, to the dynamics of stellar orbits and interacting galaxies, all the way to the expansion of the
                universe itself, we will explore the stellar dance that fills the cosmos.</p>

            <p> Satellites have become essential to modern life, even if we don’t always realize it. They enable remote
                communication, give us navigation directions on demand, assist in climate research, and can even be used
                as tools to uncover the mysteries of the Universe. But once they're in space, how long do they
                stay operational, and what happens when they stop working? With so many satellites orbiting Earth, what
                happens when it gets too crowded? These questions have been a core point in the development of
                international “Space Law.” Join us as we explore the fascinating world of satellites — their purpose,
                their risks, and how we manage the growing challenge of space debris.

            <p> In 1950 during a lunchtime conversation at Los Alamos National Laboratory, physicist Enrico Fermi asked
                “where is everybody?“. Fermi then went on to estimate that given the number of stars in the Milky Way
                Galaxy and probability of Earth-like planets, we should have been contacted by extraterrestrials by
                then. If the universe is so vast, why do we seem to be alone in it? What about the “Wow!” signal or that
                face on Mars? Maybe we have had contact and just don’t know it! Join us to discuss extraterrestrial
                signals, unexplained phenomena, and the relationship between science and the public when it comes to the
                search for extraterrestrial life.

                holes at their centers. We’ll talk about what a black hole is, how they form, and how we know they
                exist. Then we’ll discuss why it’s so surprising to see really big black holes early in the

                10 years later, we have given over 75 public talks at the Anodyne coffeeshop in Walker's Point and seen dozens of UWM 
                graduate students and postdocs participate. Most importantly we have seen our audience grow to include a mix of long-time 
                attendees as well as many newcomers just discovering our talk series. We are excited to welcome back three past members of Coffeeshop 
                Astrophysics who were integral to its growth and development. They will share with you all the cool work, scientific or otherwise,

            <p> The landscape of astrophysics research and our understanding of the universe has changed 
                dramatically over the past 10 years since the founding of Coffeeshop Astrophysics. Gravitational 
                waves were first discovered in a groundbreaking detection by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational 
                wave Observatory (LIGO). The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, some potentially habitable, 
                helped expand the horizons of planetary science. There were also enormous advancements in space 
                technology and instrumentation such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which in only a couple of 
                years has completely transformed our understanding of the universe both near and far. In this talk 
                we will review the exciting discoveries and scientific improvements of the last decade and talk 
                about what we hope to accomplish in the next ten years!

                experiments proving that the universe is not ‘locally real’. That might seem… unsettling. What does it
                mean for something to be real anyways? Come join us at Anodyne, we’ll all get through this together.

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Imagine that you’re seated by the window in Anodyne on a Sunday morning. You’re fixated
                on a puppy playing in the park outside, while simultaneously hearing the hustle and bustle of the
                coffeeshop like the hiss of the cappuccino machine, two old friends catching up on a table next to you,
                and the music playing in the background. A few minutes later you hear your name being called out. You
                look in the direction of the sound, and see the barista putting your hot espresso on the bar. While the
                ability to take in your surroundings seems automatic, it takes an immense amount of processing in the
                brain to give you an accurate and continuous representation of the world around you. In this talk, we
                will discuss how information taken in from the environment by the eyes and ears is processed by the
                brain to produce sight and hearing. First, we will discuss how the components of each system take in,
                process and synthesize information from the senses to help us understand our surroundings. Then we will
                discuss how our goals and past experiences can change what we pay attention to in our environment.
                Finally, we will point out how the brain contributes its own assumptions when it forms this
                comprehensive picture and how sometimes these assumptions can lead these representations astray.</p>

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Back in 2015 the world got its very first image of the surface of Pluto, taken from the
                New Horizons spacecraft. But since then it has continued it's epic journey out further, pushing back the
                horizon of our solar system even more. Three and a half years later, this New Year's day 2019, New
                Horizons made its latest fly-by encounter with a rocky world beyond Pluto, nicknamed Ultima Thule. This
                strange new world is not quite like any we have ever seen before, and has been likened to a "snowman"
                because of its peculiar shape. So come to learn some of the latest updates from New Horizons - what have
                we learned over the years in the time it made its closest approach to Pluto, and what are we continuing

                complex picture of our evolutionary past. Likewise, work by archeologists, primatologists, and cognitive

                lot of weather going on out in space as well! That massive, fusion-burning Sun at the center of our
                solar system often erupts with powerfully energetic particles that affect all of the planets in the
                solar system, and can create everything from beautiful aurora to devastating blackouts. The outer solar
                system delivers comets, the inner solar system contains asteroids, and space debris can often be seen
                burning up in our atmosphere as "shooting stars." Not to mention, hurricanes, lightning, and tectonic

                that will take place August 21st - a full solar eclipse! The breathtaking passage of the moon in front
                of the sun will cast a complete shadow that will carve a swath from coast to coast through the heart of
                the United States. A bit farther north where we are here in Milwaukee, the show won't be a complete
                solar eclipse, but we'll still get to see between 80-90% of the sun's light eclipsed. Join us one week
                in advance to hear about what you can expect to see. So grab your eclipse glasses, make a day trip down
                to southern Illinois if you can, and prepare for one of the greatest astronomical sights you can see
                here on this planet! </p>

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Can you imagine not being able to remember anything that ever happened, experiencing
                every minute as if it were the first one in your life? The ability to remember things we have learned
                and recall past experiences is so central to our lives that it is difficult to even imagine how we would
                be without it. Unfortunately, this ability can be severely affected in people suffering from dementia,
                brain injury, or some infectious diseases. In this session, we will explore the changes undergone by
                brain cells as we acquire new information, and the brain structures that are critically involved in
                storing, retrieving and modifying different types of memories. Finally, we will present the latest
                research on behavioural and brain changes associated with normal aging, Alzheimer's disease, and
                dementia. </p>

                even light can escape from them. Neutron stars are almost as tiny and dense as black holes, but their
                mass and gravity are small enough that they can still hold themselves up against gravity, and they emit
                light that we can see! Neutron stars are about 10 miles across, have incredibly strong magnetic fields,
                and can rotate up to nearly 1000 times per second--faster than a kitchen blender! The light they emit
                appears to pulse as they spin, just like a lighthouse, which is why we call these objects pulsars. By
                studying neutron stars and pulsars, we can learn about gravity, particle physics, magnetic fields, and

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2015 marks the 100-year anniversary of Einstein's theory of general relativity, which
                taught us to think about gravity in a completely different way than our everyday life experience:
                gravity is the curvature of spacetime. So many of the things that happen in our universe depend on the
                way spacetime curves. For example, the reason the planets orbit the Sun is the same reason that black
                holes do not shine: the fabric of spacetime becomes curved in the presence of a massive object, and we
                experience or observe this curvature as gravity. In the case of our Solar System, the Sun's gravity, or
                curvature of the spacetime around it, causes the planets to orbit it; while in the case of a black hole,
                spacetime is curved so much that light travels in circles and cannot escape. </p>
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But what <i>is</i> spacetime, and what do we mean when we say it "curves"? These
                questions (and their answers!) will be the topics of this lecture.</p>

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Are we alone in the universe? This is one of the questions we are going to explore in
                the
                next installment of CoffeeShop Astrophysics. We'll look at how planets form and discuss the methods
                scientists use to seek out other worlds. We'll also discuss aliens: what do we expect them to look like?
                Have they really visited Earth? Are they even out there? Since this is our last lecture before a winter
                hiatus, we will be giving away prizes. We hope you can join us; otherwise, stay warm and have a happy
                New Year! </p>

                    gravitational waves</font>
            </h4>
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbspHave you ever wondered how gravity works? You may picture Isaac Newton getting hit in the
                head by a falling apple. But Albert Einstein changed that view a bit. In this installment of CoffeeShop
                Astrophysics, we'll explain Einstein's view of gravity. We'll show you how this view naturally leads to
                a phenomenon that is near and dear to our hearts - something called gravitational waves! We will dicuss
                the sources of these waves, what they are and how we are trying to listen to our universe for the first
                time with lasers and dead stars.</p>

            </h4>
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the run up to Halloween what better way to get you in to the spooky spirit than to
                talk
                about 'zombie stars' - objects which keep on living after the death of a star! In this installment of
                coffeshop astrophysics we will be discussing black holes and pulsars, as well as other eerie
                astrophysical objects. Come join us to find out how we see these objects, what spacetime is and why
                spaghettification is no fun.</p>

            <h4>
                <font color='khaki'>09/27 - Live fast, die young: the lifecycle of stars</font>
            </h4>
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Sun is the most important star in our sky - without it, life on Earth could never
                exist. Have you ever wondered how the Sun has continued to shine for all these years, or what would
                happen if the Sun went away? In this installment of coffeeshop astrophysics, we'll talk about how stars
                are born, how they produce light, why some stars have shorter or longer lives, and what happens when
                they start to run out of fuel. Perhaps most excitingly, we'll talk about what happens when stars die,
                and the tiny, dense remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and even black holes!) they leave behind.</p>

            <h4>
                <font color='khaki'>09/06 - The Big Bang</font>
            </h4>
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou've probably heard that our universe began in a Big Bang. But what does that really
                mean? And why do astrophysicists view the Big Bang as the best scientific explanation for the formation
                of our universe? To find out the answers to these questions and more, join us for the first meeting of
                Coffeeshop Astrophysics. In this informal setting, we'll show you the discoveries that led to our
                current understanding of the explosive birth of our universe, and we'll answer any questions you may
                have about how our universe came to be.</p>
