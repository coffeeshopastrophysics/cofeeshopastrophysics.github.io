                    <p><i>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We are excited to have a guest speaker join us for this event!  Dr. Julie Paque graduated from Shorewood High School, went to University of Tennessee-Knoxville, and then Caltech for graduate work.  She has worked at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Stanford, SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute, and recently retired from Caltech. Through all of her jobs her work has focused on the early history of the solar system. </i></p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago by the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core, which resulted in the formation of a circumsolar disk of gas and dust (called the solar nebula). Most meteorites come from asteroids located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. We are fortunate that some of these meteorites have remained unchanged since their formation. I will talk about my research on 4.5 billion year old Ca-Al-rich Inclusions from carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, and how we can use information from these small objects to tell us about the conditions present in the early history of the solar system.

                    <br/>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you were the size of an atom? Well, behavior at this scale changes so much that physicists have given it its own category of physics, Quantum Mechanics.  Come find out just how differently objects of this size, such as light, behave compared to classical everyday objects.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We're all familiar with it, that collection of all of the basic atomic elements we have discovered organized by their common properties which we call the Periodic Table of Elements.  They form the building blocks of essentially everything we can see with our eyes in the universe, but where did they come from?  If you break down one of these atoms you get a collection of things like protons, neutrons, and electrons, but how do you put them together to build an atom in the first place?  In this talk we will explore the ways in which the universe's factories produce nature's building blocks!  </p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Our eyes are windows into the world around us.  These biological lenses focus light and allow our brains to process everything we see.  Our understanding of lenses gave us the invention of the telescope, which has forever changed the way we understand not only our world, but the universe around us.  But these traditional telescopes are not the only way in which we can bring distant objects into focus.  Using our amazing understanding of math and physics we might in the future be able to turn other objects, not just glass, into extremely powerful lenses, to build alternative and radically new types of "telescopes."  So come to this talk and we'll look at the ways in which we might be able to turn objects such as the Earth or even the Sun into the lenses of future telescopes. </p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You may have seen it in the news back in April of this year, a team of scientists from around the world managed to take the first direct image of one of the universe's most enigmatic objects - a black hole.  This tremendous accomplishment required the combined strength of telescopes from all around the world working together, effectively creating an Earth-sized telescope!  How was all of this achieved, and moreover, how do you take a picture of an object which consumes all light that touches it, an object which for all intents and purposes, is invisible?

Where is art inspired by science, and where does it take its own liberties?  What does the reality behind the science fiction imply by the possible future technologies we might achieve?  Well from the massive star forge that created Thor's mighty hammer in Marvel's "Infinity War," to the far looking galactic society that we could become in Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series of novels, we hope you join us for a fun look into the possibly real, and the really possible!</p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Imagine that you’re seated by the window in Anodyne on a Sunday morning. You’re fixated on a puppy playing in the park outside, while simultaneously hearing the hustle and bustle of the coffeeshop like the hiss of the cappuccino machine, two old friends catching up on a table next to you, and the music playing in the background. A few minutes later you hear your name being called out. You look in the direction of the sound, and see the barista putting your hot espresso on the bar. While the ability to take in your surroundings seems automatic, it takes an immense amount of processing in the brain to give you an accurate and continuous representation of the world around you. In this talk, we will discuss how information taken in from the environment by the eyes and ears is processed by the brain to produce sight and hearing. First, we will discuss how the components of each system take in, process and synthesize information from the senses to help us understand our surroundings. Then we will discuss how our goals and past experiences can change what we pay attention to in our environment. Finally, we will point out how the brain contributes its own assumptions when it forms this comprehensive picture and how sometimes these assumptions can lead these representations astray.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Think of the things that you use or encounter every day.  If one day you were abducted by aliens and asked to explain how the technology of our civilization worked, do you think you could do it?  Things like the television, telephones, GPS, and cameras, which you may use regularly.  Or perhaps even items you may have never stopped to consider, like smoke detectors, anti-shoplifting alarms, or even… your toaster – do you actually understand how they work?  We live in a society propped up on its technology, but yet if you stopped for a moment to try and explain how that stuff worked, you might find yourself at a loss for words.  So come join us as we try to shed light on some of these commonly used items, which work in fascinating ways!</p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Back in 2015 the world got its very first image of the surface of Pluto, taken from the New Horizons spacecraft.  But since then it has continued it's epic journey out further, pushing back the horizon of our solar system even more.  Three and a half years later, this New Year's day 2019, New Horizons made its latest fly-by encounter with a rocky world beyond Pluto, nicknamed Ultima Thule.  This strange new world is not quite like any we have ever seen before, and has been likened to a "snowman" because of its peculiar shape.  So come to learn some of the latest updates from New Horizons - what have we learned over the years in the time it made its closest approach to Pluto, and what are we continuing to learn about some of the outer-most reaches of our solar system.</p>

While these types of weather don't occur here on Earth, they can occur on other planets.  In fact, the weather on other planets can be far more extreme.  So from the storm on Jupiter which has lasted for centuries, to the run-away greenhouse effect which has rendered Venus perhaps completely uninhabitable, to perhaps the even more extreme weather that may occur on planets throughout our galaxy and universe, be sure to join us to learn more about the ever fascinating forecasts of extraterrestrial space weather!</p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Our understanding of human origins and evolution has changed dramatically over the last several decades. Once viewed as a smooth, linear succession of progressively larger-brained and more human-like hominids, new fossil discoveries and genetic sequencing data have uncovered a much more complex picture of our evolutionary past. Likewise, work by archeologists, primatologists, and cognitive scientists points to a highly intricate pattern of similarities and differences between the minds of humans and non-human animals, thus revealing important clues about how our minds have been shaped by evolution. In this talk, we will review some of the most important discoveries and how they shaped the current scientific views on the subject.</p>

That massive, fusion-burning Sun at the center of our solar system often erupts with powerfully energetic particles that affect all of the planets in the solar system, and can create everything from beautiful aurora to devastating blackouts.  The outer solar system delivers comets, the inner solar system contains asteroids, and space debris can often be seen burning up in our atmosphere as "shooting stars."  Not to mention, hurricanes, lightning, and tectonic movement are all things that have been observed on other planets and moons, not just here on planet Earth.

The ability to remember things we have learned and recall past experiences is so central to our lives that it is difficult to even imagine how we would be without it. Unfortunately, this ability can be severely affected in people suffering from dementia, brain injury, or some infectious diseases. In this session, we will explore the changes undergone by brain cells as we acquire new information, and the brain structures that are critically involved in storing, retrieving and modifying different types of memories. Finally, we will present the latest research on behavioural and brain changes associated with normal aging, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. </p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We live in an era where the experiments we run allow us to collect more data than anyone could ever hope to study by themselves in their own lifetime.  We need all of the help that we can get - so would you like to don the lab-coat and become a scientist yourself?  Many projects, including <a href="https://einsteinathome.org/"><font color='magenta'>Einstein@home</font></a>, <a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/"><font color='magenta'>SETI@home</font></a>, or the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/"><font color='magenta'>Zooniverse projects</font></a>, allow you to help out in the collective pursuit of knowledge, from hunting for gravitational waves, to listening for extraterrestrial life, to studies in biology, history, medicine, language, and more!  And all from your own personal computer.  So come join us to learn more about what some of these projects are, how they work, and what you can do to be a part of them! </p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There isn’t just empty space between the stars.  The material between stars, called the interstellar medium or ISM, is mostly gas and dust and can have an enormous range of temperatures and densities.  Stars form from the ISM and supernovae blast new material into the ISM.  We use the ISM to understand what galaxies are made of and how galaxies are rotating.  In this talk, we will explain what the ISM is and how we can use it to understand galaxies. </p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We’ve all heard of the “greats” in astronomy: Kepler, Copernicus, Hubble, etc. Instead of focusing on these prominent figures, let’s celebrate the women scientists whose contributions to modern astronomy have all too often been overlooked.  From revelations in dark matter to pulsars, and from the classification of stars themselves to astronauts who have traveled to space, these women’s contributions to astronomy and science have been nothing short of stellar, and have changed the way we understand the universe around us. </p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lenses and mirrors allow us to bend and focus light, and through their construction in telescopes they have allowed humans to see faint objects in the far off reaches of our universe.  And in a similar way to how your glasses help focus light into your eyes so you can see better, massive objects in space such as stars or galaxies can bend and focus light towards Earth, coming from objects far away.  So picture the largest telescope that you have ever seen.  Now, do you think humans could build one as large as the solar system itself...? </p>

So what we are going to do is to present to you some famous examples of science fiction concepts that have been portrayed in films, books, comics, and popular culture in general, what about them is based from real science, and where creative license has taken its liberties!  So from the profetic mind of Jules Verne in the novel "From the Earth to the Moon," through the wormholes of the "Stargate" franchise, to contact with extraterrestrial life, to the rise of artificial intelligence like HAL 9000, we hope you join us for this fun exploration of the science of science-fiction! </p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Active Galactic Nuclei, or AGN, are ultra-luminous central regions of galaxies where radiation is emitted from a supermassive black hole as matter falls onto it. They are the most luminous continuous sources of light in the universe, which makes them some of the most distant observable objects. The study of AGN is one of the largest fields in modern astronomy. During this talk we will discuss what these objects are and how they are used to study large scale-structure in the universe in addition to telling us how galaxies form and evolve through time. </p>

With the aid of telescopes, astronomers observe the light coming from different objects to help them understand the universe better.  In this talk, we’ll describe what light actually is and how we can extract information from it to learn about our universe.  Want to know what an object is made of?  How hot it is?

Each of these stepping stones has further advanced our space exploration technology and has allowed us to go further, faster, and for longer durations, leading us ever closer to the goal of human space travel. </p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You've probably heard of black holes--objects so dense, with such massive gravity,  not even light can escape from them. Neutron stars are almost as tiny and dense as black holes, but their mass and gravity are small enough that they can still hold themselves up against gravity, and they emit light that we can see! Neutron stars are about 10 miles across, have incredibly strong magnetic fields, and can rotate up to nearly 1000 times per second--faster than a kitchen blender! The light they emit appears to pulse as they spin, just like a lighthouse, which is why we call these objects pulsars. By studying neutron stars and pulsars, we can learn about gravity, particle physics, magnetic fields, and other physics in environments so extreme that they cannot be produced on Earth. </p>

In this lecture we will explore nature on the smallest of scales, look at how science has changed our perspective of the "elements" of nature and what the fundamental forces are, and hear more about that ominous sounding theory which governs it all - quantum mechanics!  We will also explore how scientists study these amazing theories, where particle physicists in laboratories like CERN (home of the largest machine ever constructed by mankind - the Large Hadron Collider) are smashing subatomic particles at nearly the speed of light to recreate conditions that were similar to just moments after the Big Bang itself!</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity revolutionized humanity's understanding of gravity.  Instead of gravity acting like a rope that holds the Earth in orbit around the Sun, Einstein showed that gravity is the curvature of <I>spacetime</I>&#8212;the very fabric of our universe.  His theory makes many predictions about the way stars, planets, and even light should travel through curved spacetime, all of which have been shown to be correct.  There is one final test of Einstein's theory, which has continued to elude scientists:  the <I>direct detection</I> of gravitational radiation, or gravitational waves.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As some of you might now know, gravitational waves have now been directly detected! In this lecture, we will explain how scientists actually search for gravitational waves&#8212;including many of the physicists at UWM!  You will hear from some of the graduate students and postdocs who are in LIGO, and who were directly involved in this historic discovery.  They will tell you all about LIGO and the discovery of gravitational waves!</p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2015 marks the 100-year anniversary of Einstein's theory of general relativity, which taught us to think about gravity in a completely different way than our everyday life experience:  gravity is the curvature of spacetime.  So many of the things that happen in our universe depend on the way spacetime curves.  For example, the reason the planets orbit the Sun is the same reason that black holes do not shine: the fabric of spacetime becomes curved in the presence of a massive object, and we experience or observe this curvature as gravity.  In the case of our Solar System, the Sun's gravity, or curvature of the spacetime around it, causes the planets to orbit it; while in the case of a black hole, spacetime is curved so much that light travels in circles and cannot escape. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But what <i>is</i> spacetime, and what do we mean when we say it "curves"?  These questions (and their answers!) will be the topics of this lecture.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Most of us have a reasonable understanding of how organs such as the heart or the lungs work to keep us alive, but have you ever wondered how the brain -- a three-pound lump of goo -- is able to generate thoughts, memories, emotions, intentions, and voluntary actions? Science tells us that all these mental experiences result from the activity of the brain, but figuring out exactly how the brain gives rise to the mind is one of the major scientific challenges of our time.

Until the last few months, the best image we had of Pluto was a pixellated image from the Hubble Space Telescope.  But, on July 14, after nine years of travel, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft reached its closest approach in its fly-by mission to Pluto.  In this CoffeeShop lecture, we will discuss what has been learned from the mission so far, and will show the amazing new images taken by the New Horizons mission -- our first close-up views of this distant world.</p>
